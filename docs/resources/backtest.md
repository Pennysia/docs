# Backtest

We're thrilled to present the compelling results of our extensive backtest, demonstrating how the Pennysia AMM Protocol, with its innovative Liquidity Prediction Market (LPM), consistently outperforms traditional Automated Market Makers (AMMs) like Uniswap V2.

Pennysia's core innovation lies in its Liquidity Prediction Market (LPM), which allows Liquidity Providers (LPs) to take long or short positions on a token, essentially making a "prediction" about its future price direction. If an LP's prediction is correct, they stand to earn amplified trading fees.

## Methodology
- We utilized four years of historical price action data, from 2021 to 2024, capturing both bullish and bearish market cycles.
- Both Pennysia and Uniswap V2 pools were set up with equal base liquidity and equal user investment.
- We tested 144 strategies test, ranging from 100% long/short to balanced allocations.
- The backtest incorporated realistic, price-driven trading scenarios and exact fee redistribution mechanics, reflecting real-world conditions.


## Key Findings - Proven Advantages
- **Substantial and Statistically Robust Outperformance**: Pennysia’s directional positioning consistently beats Uniswap V2 in average returns and strategy success rates.
- **Significant Gains in Trending & Volatile Markets**: Pennysia's protocol is especially powerful in trending and volatile markets. Our price movement analysis clearly revealed that Pennysia’s edge is greatest during these conditions. A specific case study on GALA pairs highlighted how Pennysia can capture exponential gains in extreme bull markets, showcasing its ability to capitalize on market momentum
- **Optimal Strategies Identified for Maximized Returns**: While extreme positioning (100% long or short) can yield the highest rewards in strong trends, the backtest showed that 75% directional strategies offer the best risk/reward balance. This insight is critical for LPs to optimize their capital allocation.
- **Fee Mechanics Drive Amplified Returns**: Pennysia's sophisticated fee redistribution system amplifies the advantage of being on the right side of the market. LPs whose predictions are correct not only earn standard trading fees but also receive extra trading fees deducted from those with incorrect predictions. These double fees are intended to offset Impermanent Loss (IL), a common concern for LPs in traditional AMMs.
- **Indirect Capital Efficiency Boost**: Although LPM doesn't directly increase Capital Efficiency (CE) like concentrated liquidity models (e.g., Uniswap V3), it attracts more liquidity providers due to the visibly high Annual Percentage Rates (APR) displayed on the app, thereby indirectly increasing capital efficiency by drawing more capital into the pools

## Why Pennysia Matters for Your Investment Strategy: 
Pennysia is built on the robust and proven Uniswap V2 constant product formula, ensuring always-available liquidity. What sets it apart is the added layer of the LPM, which enhances user earning opportunities by rewarding LPs based on their accurate price predictions. 

Crucially, this unique model allows LPs to benefit from directional bets **without the liquidation risk** typically associated with leveraged trading – you cannot lose more than your initial deposit. This makes Pennysia an engaging new way to earn passive income, potentially offering **significantly higher APRs**.
